I. Show the stack, solution to last week

II. Hash function

- A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes

- Inserting 1,2,3,4,5 in an array, want to find if 5 does exists
 => Go From 1 -> 5
- However, a better solution is use an array called exists just take value 0,1
	0 is false
	1 is true
- However, if the number if 100000000, we cannot define an array that has 1 billion elements
-> We are using hash table

- 14,30,17,55,31,29,16
 1. hash(x) of ( x % 13 ) (Linear Probing)
 2. - hash2(x) of ( x % 5 ) + 1 (Double hashing)
    - linear probing is just double-hashing where hash2(x) = 1 always.
 3. Linear chaining
 4. Find a prime number to reduce the probability of collision
